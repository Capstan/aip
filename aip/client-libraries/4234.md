# Bazel protobuf targets

When using Bazel to compile protobuf and generate message libraries and RPC service
libraries, the naming choice for these targets has implications on derivative targets, and
those target names have implications for per-language integrations. By applying a common
approach to how individual `.proto` files are combined into targets, and to what those
targets are named, clients can have a uniform experience from API to API.

Some of the various language constraints are as follows:

*   Java's `option java_outer_classname`: per the API style guide is the name of
    the proto file, with "Proto" appended. Unless `option java_multiple_files` is true,
    the file name defines the packaging of the types.
*   Go's target names will define the import path for the result. However, Go's package
    names have a more restrictive character set (e.g., no dashes), and in some cases, that
    means that the import path and package name will disagree. This interferes with some
    tooling.

## Guidance

### Targets

In the following file name cases, if the service name or resource name is more than one
word, they should be separated by underscores.

#### Services and request/response messages

Individual services along with their request and response messages **should** live in
separate `proto_library` targets, named `{service}_service_proto`.

**NOTE:** Services **should** not share request or response messages. Reuse of resources
or common messages is preferred.
    
#### Resource messages

*   Resources that are a primary resource for an individual service, **should** be 
    in a `proto_library` target named `{resource}_proto`.
*   Otherwise, per-service resources **should** be in a `proto_library` target named 
    `{service}_resources_proto`.
*   If there are remaining shared resources, they **should** be in a `proto_library`
    target named `resources_proto`.
    
#### Additional messages

Remaining necessary messages **should** be in a `proto_library` target named
`common_proto`.

### `.proto` file naming convention

In the case where there's a single `.proto` file in the `srcs` of the
`proto_library`, it should be named by replacing the `_proto` suffix with `.proto`.

### `{lang}_proto_library` naming convention

The per-language rules, e.g., `cc_proto_library`, **should** be named by replacing the
`_proto` suffix on the `proto_library` target with `_{lang}_proto`. e.g.,

```
proto_library(name = "foo_proto", …)
cc_proto_library(name = "foo_cc_proto", deps = [":foo_proto"], …)
```

### `{lang}_{rpc}_library` naming convention

The per-language, per-RPC rules, e.g., `cc_grpc_library`, **should** be named by replacing
the `_proto` suffix on the `{lang}_proto_library` target with `_{rpc}`. e.g.,

```
cc_proto_library(name = "bar_service_cc_proto", deps = [":bar_service_proto"], …)
cc_grpc_library(
    name = "bar_service_cc_grpc",
    srcs = [":bar_service_proto"],
    deps = [":bar_service_cc_proto"],
    …
)
```

### Adding services

If in the course of an alpha or beta period for an API, one or more new services are added
or resources are made shared or specific such that they'd belong to a different or new
`proto_library` target,

*   Prefer incrementing the _Y_ of vXalphaY to a new version and making the changes
    there, allowing clients to update at their leisure.
*   If the change is to be made intra-version, then use the [`import public`
    declaration][] to preserve the set of messages exposed by the older target(s) during
    the conversion or deprecation period, if applicable. **NOTE:** `import public` works
    with messages, not with RPC services.
